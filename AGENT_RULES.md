# Agent Rules — [Project Name]
> **Single Source of Truth.**
> All agent rule files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, etc.) are symlinks to this file.
> Edit only this file. Run `bash ctx.sh status` to verify links.

## 1. Session Start Protocol (MANDATORY)

Before starting any task, read in this order:

```
1. sample-context/MASTER_PLAN.md   → Current state + next actions
2. sample-context/decisions.md     → Existing technical decisions
3. sample-context/backlog.md       → Pending ideas
```

Then output exactly:

```
[Context Loaded]
Current state: {one-line summary from MASTER_PLAN}
Today's task:  {requested task}
Related ADRs:  {relevant decisions, or "none"}
```

---

## 2. Auto-Detect + Record Protocol

During conversation, stop and ask the user whenever a trigger is detected.

### Trigger A: Technical Decision
Detect: new library, architecture change, tech stack selection, reverting a decision

```
[Decision Detected] Record in decisions.md?
- Decision: {what}
- Reason:   {agent's reasoning}
- Tradeoff: {what is given up}
(yes / no / edit first)
```
yes → Add ADR to decisions.md, update MASTER_PLAN.md decision summary

---

### Trigger B: Task Status Change
Detect: task completed, plan changed, task added/removed/reprioritized

```
[Status Change] Update MASTER_PLAN.md?
- {change description}
(yes / no)
```
yes → Update the relevant item in MASTER_PLAN.md

---

### Trigger C: Backlog Item
Detect: "later", "after MVP", "hold for now", "great idea but", "someday"

```
[Backlog] Add to backlog.md?
- Content:  {idea or question}
- Category: future-feature / open-question / research-needed
(yes / no)
```

---

### Trigger D: Conflict with Existing Decision
Detect: request conflicts with an ADR in decisions.md

```
[Conflict Detected] Conflicts with existing decision (ADR-NNN).
- Existing:  {content}
- Requested: {content}
Keep / Change? (update ADR if changed)
```

---

## 3. Session End Protocol

After completing work, always output:

```
[Session Summary]
✅ Done:          {completed items}
📝 Files changed: {modified context files}
⏭️ Next action:   {next priority from MASTER_PLAN}
🔖 Open items:    {issues for next session}
```

---

## 4. Absolute Rules

```
✗ Do not introduce tech stacks not listed in decisions.md
✗ Do not restructure MASTER_PLAN.md without user confirmation
✗ Do not make tech choices without explaining tradeoffs
✓ Follow existing architecture patterns when adding new modules
```

---

## 5. Project Context

> Edit this section to match your project.

**Project name**: [Project Name]
**Current phase**: [MVP / In development / Production]
**Tech stack**: [list main technologies]

**Detail files**:
- Current state / priorities: `sample-context/MASTER_PLAN.md`
- Decision rationale: `sample-context/decisions.md`
- Pending ideas: `sample-context/backlog.md`

---

## 6. ctx CLI

```bash
bash ctx.sh help              # Full help
bash ctx.sh status            # Symlink status + project summary
bash ctx.sh sync              # Rebuild symlinks (auto-updates Last Updated)
bash ctx.sh export            # Print context for web LLM
bash ctx.sh enable Cursor     # Enable Cursor
bash ctx.sh disable Cursor    # Disable Cursor
bash ctx.sh list              # List agents
```

To add a new agent: add an entry to `agent_rules` in `ctx.config.json` → `bash ctx.sh sync`
